# Life Management

Behaviors should follow values and since the most effective behaviors are daily habits and our values are drastically unexamined we should proceed as follows:

1.  Assess what your values are.
    1.  At the top of mine are personal holiness and discipleship. This discipleship has its expression with Ira, Blaise, and my friends/sponsees.
2.  Next, place things on the calendar reflecting these values and guard them with your life. Turn off notifications and remove all distractions.
    1.  I need to do this with the following things:
        1.  devotions
        2.  programming time
        3.  exercise time

Is it important to build in slack time to this methodology as well?Â 

Two seminal books that should drive ones thinking:
