# Micro-content and Automated Learning

*   Set up Jupyter quiz project
*   Feed news API and do micro-content post using notes and POC
*   Short-form genre media as modelable domain

It is admitted that ML is simply "curve fitting” within a strictly defined domain. If we reimagine genre and subgenera as rigidly defined domains then we make it possible to apply the newest ML capabilities to reduce content creation to ETL procedures. Content generation reduced to ETL and a build step using only data as input.

Media genre types (list the domains):

1.  News
    1.  Targeted news (makes it possible to create specific content feeds like RSS)
    2.  Breaking news/videos (speed to market)
2.  Education 3. Machine driven education and [evaluation](https://medium.com/swlh/practical-ai-automatically-generate-true-or-false-questions-from-any-content-with-openai-gpt2-9081ffe4d4c9)
3.  Entertainment 4. DJ/VJ montages (viral, music, movies, etc) 5. [OpenSource](https://opensource.com/life/10/8/science-fiction-thoughtcrime-experiments) or [procedurally generated fiction](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/6/20998993/ai-dungeon-2-choose-your-own-adventure-game-text-nick-walton-gpt-machine-learning)

This is the trick. Work backward from the structure of genre and format and then find or create the data to feed it. Existing content can’t automatically be restructured to fit the content templates without extensive manual work.

The platforms:

1.  Video
    1.  Social network ‘stories’
    2.  Alexa and Google ‘show’ devices
2.  Audio 3. Interactive audio may be an entirely new platform because of always in earbuds. 4. Alexa, Siri, etc

The plan: Launch successful channels for each domain (fully automated)

‘Hacking Your Perspective’ video generation project to do:

*   Update original blogpost (video content edits)
*   Update Medium post (video content edits)
*   Rebuild generated video using MD file with assets
*   Determine the best aspect ratio for images and video resources
*   Add stinger intro to the video
*   Add music to the background of the episode?
*   Speed up voice
*   Too much text on non-reversed gif is weird
*   Improperly sized images are too zoomed in
*   Brand voice is strange (written from a personal perspective)
*   How can gifs be resized without losing animation?
*   Blockquotes should be added to the written version and video

How could this be used?

1.  Volume content production (daily serials)
2.  Leverage News API (daily, breaking, etc)
3.  Multi-language support
4.  Instructional videos
5.  Daily devotional
6.  Use ci/cd to ensure all images and video are the correct sizes
7.  [Short-form entertainment production](https://www.inc.com/john-hall/why-short-form-video-is-poised-to-take-a-bigger-chunk-of-marketing-spend.html')
    1.  [Quibi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quibi)
    2.  TikTok
    3.  Snapchat
    4.  Kids entertainment

The resulting generated video: [https://youtu.be/R0cLj-z912g](https://youtu.be/R0cLj-z912g)

Next steps:

*   Generate the video programmatically from source using MD file
*   Include audio, video, and animated gifs (if possible)

Construction questions:

*   What is the ideal frame length?
*   How does this relate to social media ‘stories’?

Why:

*   Can simultaneously target IG and Pinterest
*   Can incorporate GPT-2 content generation

I need to:

1.  Start using Pinterest art inspiration and the [transformer bot](https://talktotransformer.com/) to write short stories to be converted to video with [VideoPuppet](https://www.videopuppet.com/) and posted on Youtube.
