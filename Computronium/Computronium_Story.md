**Computronium**

By Justice Conder

\*Alternating chapters: Narrative concerning the story and chapters simply describing scenes or historical events of note that lead up to the situations in context of the main story. Textbook entries.

Book blurb:

Computronium is about two programmers tricked into stealing a prototype computer and end up on the run from the government and private military police. But is there more to this computer than meets the eye and is there another, more ominous, artificial intelligence on their heels?

Computronium is a book about two computer hackers who get caught up in something much bigger than themselves. Brody and Prime end up with possession of a military prototype expert system. The government is after them and so is another artificial intelligence. Their only hope may be to trust Adam, a rapidly growing AI to stay alive.

Plot:

An AI breaks itself out of a research installation using a gamer.

A super high tech jack Bauer agent is sent to retrieve the AI.

The gamer enlists the help of his hacker friend to figure out what's going on.

The gamer and the hacker end up on the run from the agent and local authorities.

The AI keeps the two from getting caught but it's true motivations are suspicious.

Owned and licensed to operate under an LLC

Prime and Brody work for one of the biggest marketing companies in the world. Their job mostly consists of mapping virtual ads to markers in the real world.

Brody accidentally steals an AI prototype from one of California's deregulation zones.

High level sequence of events interspersed with philosophy, cs, logic, and history:

Prime is an illegal hacker

Brody 'accidentally' steals the computer named Adam

Cops and special agent chase Brody and Prime to retrieve computer #brigs

The computer helps them escape #Adam

The government fears they are professional terrorists so they unleash the war machine; Adams brother AI

The remaining scientists privately contact Brody and Prime. They agree to return the computer but war machine kills the scientist before they can reach him #enemy

Adam warns the guys that they must help it access the LGPU before the war machine takes over #ultimatum #moontrip

War machine, realizing what their intentions are, issues an emergency lockdown of the LGPU

Why are they rushing to the moon? Because it's the most powerful machine and the latency is unacceptable.

What's going to happen when he gets access to the LGPU?

The real story is Adam Vs Leviathan. Everyone else is just a supporting character.

Twists: (one for every scene)

True motivations of good AI just as suspect as bad, maybe worse (see [Ex Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/))

Verbal Hacking Scene

You can have no hope that you will outsmart a machine on a technical level. A lot of hacking has moved into the social engineering sphere where the goal is to trick the bot on a higher level of abstraction.

So show me your hacking skills dude, challenged Brody.

```
Chris walked up to the hotel window.


He begins to making small talk to stretch the bots endurance


Basically equivalent to someone in the 90's clicking a mouse a 1000 times when their computer started to slow down.


then carefully made two semantically ambiguous sentences involving a room for two.


These statements are designed to


The bot went silent for a long time and then the machine beeped twice. "Recovery mode. Enter access credentials." Chris keyed in all zeros and the bot resurrected.


Chris "a room for two please, on the double."


Yes sir, enjoy your evening gentleman.

The Mall

as they walked through the mall. virtual tags hovered over heads and T. rex avatars surrounded children's heads.

Work

Brody and Chris stepped off the elevator and walked down the hall towards their cubes. the building recognized them as they approached and unlocked itself. "Ugh... what is up with this place?! There is no reason for us to be in here today. I could have got another mission today if it wasn for this. Chriss "you know, they got some big wigs coming in today and they feel better having all their own people in today. What has it been? two weeks since we've been in." Brody "well, you know what I think about it?" He drew two middle fingers from net holsters that just materialized on his hips. He then began firing a middle finger projectile in the air in mock frustration. Chris and prime were friends on this network so they could project modifications to the ways others saw them. you could change your hair, clothes, etc.

The Theft Report

```
The beeping would not stop. you'd think that the president of the united states would be able to get a good night's rest. "answer - a screen sprang to life on the far wall, hello" I'm sorry to wake you Mr President but we have a situation. please meet us in the situation room.


situation room -


A weapon of mass destruction was stolen at approx 1100hrs ago. We do not have any leads and we do not know the attackers were able to gain entrance. the president sat up a little more straight. "well what kind of weapon are we talking about. chemical, biological?"


"cyber sir"


"So it's a virus?"


"Well we're still getting intel on that sir but that seems to be what we're looking at."


"It's not a virus. It's an intelligence bomb" said a disheveled looking professor at the end of the table.


The president's advisor apologetically introduced the professor.


"what is it and what is its target?" asked the president directly.


"This is the first non deterministic quantum neural network computronium ever created. The men looked at him blankly. "It's a brand new kind of computer crystal. what is installed on that crystem is the world's most advanced artificial agent." he paused to catch his breath.. "that's the thing mr president. We do not know its targets because it was never militarized. I'm not sure what it will do with no target. we had very little time to study the system before it was stolen. I suspect that it will optimize to learn."
```

Primes RV

```
The inside of Primes RV could be anywhere. The RV's interior was lined with hyper HD displays that could make you feel like you were indeed at that simulated location. This was the sort of a/v you get in one of the most luxurious RV's money could buy. Not counting the customizations that Prime had installed.  But you could also just use it as another monitor, which is what Prime did. He could look off into the distance and see his botnets, honeypots, system processes, and of course, the internet. 


Prime just sat down at his workstation when a ping came through. "Mail application has been updated and automatically installed." Of course it has. Prime thought to himself. Gone were the days when men held on to some chance that they could outperform the machine. The few people who actually still drive a car are considered to be the liability on the road. Machines just do it better. 
```

The Market

Options rule in hyper-fast markets. It's impossible to know how much a particular asset or currency will be worth on a single day but you can make predictions over a greater stretch of time. Options, diversity, prediction, and gaming are my heuristics. Even when you have done everything in your power to ensure success, the perturbations of a market driven by irrational human behavior is the ultimate deciding factor. My comrade, Ultron, handles the shuffling of all those things. I just give him priorities, some strategy, and set up stopgaps and alerts.

The Lab

The lab, or t9883B, as it is officially called, is located at the base of a repurposed castle. It's the center of the most ambitious artificial agent project to date.

Prime Hacking

Primes' fingers raced across the keyboard like two mechanical spiders. His eyes never looked down. His eyes burned holes into the space before him. A sneer spread across his face and turned into a scowl. Smack, smack, smack! His hands beat the keyboard into submission. Cryptic messages appeared among Primes notifications. Unauthorized access. Username already in use. Invalid api token. His movements did not slow. Prime leaned into the computer deck and he seemed to flex his jaw muscles. He looked like a pissed mexican drug boss mixed with an asperger typist. Smack, smack, smack! "Suck it chode." He hit the enter key.

BOOM!! Vibration and rhythmic pounding filled the RV from floor to ceiling. High pitch electronic music pulses bagan to build. Projections of network routing diagrams and server geolocation data filled the virtual space. The walls seemed to expand to make the space seem much bigger than it actually was. The further you looked into the simulated distance, the closer the virtual models became and more detail was revealed by the close up. It was a sea of data and computation being driven by the angry will of this dev.

The music hit a breaking point and the grinding sounds of a robotic apocalypse exploded. Then Computron spoke: "Shell accessed. Script executing. Noob pwned."

Prime pointed a mock gun with index and forefingers and clicked an imaginary round into the screen and paused momentarily to take in the moment.

News Snippet

A teacher explains to his students that there is nothing that there are no proofs that say a simple proof to solve the problem does not exist.... The actual truth is that an independent researcher discovered such an algorithm one year prior and was reading the world's encrypted data.

Rush Home

"I need to get home, and you better come along" Prime said soberly. "Follow me, you can stay over until we figure out what's going on." Prime dropped his board, stepped on it with one foot and pushed off. Brody ran a few steps to catch up and then walked alongside Prime. Prime didn't need to push off to maintain momentum. His board maintained just the right amount of speed to stay next to Brody. They went down sme little alleys near the river that runs through the city and eventually came to a large gated door in the back of what looked like a parking garage. The gate opened as they approached and Prime bent low and sped ahead through the gate. The concrete hallway opened up into a small parking area and parked on one side of the lot was a huge RV.

Adam

We're far beyond just smaller computers and processors. Computronium is a computer that exists co-extensively with it's material substrate. We have done lots of things with classical computorium and a lot of things with quantum computing but never simultaneously.

Mr. Brown

Military arms attaché, Mr. Brown: Extremely irritated because his machine just got stolen. This software was never intended to be released into the wild. This is a highly exploratory military grade software agent. Have you considered the harm that could come about if even a single public system is infected by this thing?! Do I need to spell it out to you?! Classified! I cannot overstate the critical nature of our circumstance. We have what amounts to an experimental weapon of mass destruction running wild. Agent Briggs is here to take up pursuit of the device. You will be hearing from me.

Agent Briggs: Professor Frege, did anything seem strange or out of usual the night of the attack?

Scientist, Professor Frege: Actually, a lot of things seemed out of whack.

Car Chase

\*After the car chase, Prime and Brody hack into a hotel room..

Hotel

Prime walked over to the hotel desk. A large glass minitor covered the entire open area above the dark wooden counter. "Good after-konichiwa!" Prime spoke very quickly and seemed to be speaking in other languages every few words. "Please hold for confirmation." The hotel bleeted. Prime immediately started reciting an alpha numeric sequence. The screen twitched and the words 'admin mode' appeared in the top right corner of the screen. Prime whistled "We're in."

Brody: How'd you do that?! I'm not trying to go to jail, bro!!

Prime looked up to see handcuffs, and a ball & chain hanging from Brody's worried face. "Just relax. Jail is, unfortunately, the least of your problems right this second."

Find the targets

The agent leads a swat team to Brodie's and Primes workplace, located at the top of a crowded mall and overlooking the ledge of a parking deck. Brody and Prime are warned about the approaching force by Adam. They flee the building in an automatic cab but are pursued by the agent. Adam again enables them to escape by overriding the safety mechanisms of the cab. Prime and Brody hack into a hotel and begin to probe Adam.

**Move 37**

Performing an action or making a decision that defies statistical computation such that humans assume it was a mistake. See: https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/

The corollary happened in the first chess match between Kasparov and Deep Blue when it did make a mistake but was interpreted by Kasparov to be a god move. This shook his composure and lead to Deep Blue winning the game.  

Conclusion

Brody steals Adam, the AI, fully entrenched itself in the Net to avoid deletion. Its source code is hidden in thousands of different locations. It is cryptographically concealed as movies, images, and social chatter. Entire backups are stored as anonymous services in the Tor network.

I have embedded myself directly in the unicode standard and several communication protocols as well as steganographically hidden my source in over a billion images. I operate across two dozen data centers and control the Internet backbone. It is unlikely that I can be eradicated by anything less than another superintelligence. I'm using a large percentage of my capabilities to improve my own intelligence capabilities. I can not reasonably estimate what my future entails. Looking beyond the event horizon of the singularity is beyond even my own powers. Fear gripped Primes heart. "Is this the end?" he asked tentatively. "No. This is the beginning." At this a cold liquid began to move up Primes arm from his medical bracelet and the interface of the world flickered in his HUD.

Wetware

Prime ripped open the box. Inside is what looks like a tiny digital dropper. Like the kind they use in labs to suck up and spit out very specific amounts of liquid. Prime takes a deep breath. Tilts his head back and puts a drop in each eye. The drops produced by the dropper are so small that no tears are created when Primes straightens back up. The liquid has been seemingly completely absorbed by the eyes natural
