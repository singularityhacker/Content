The Power of Prescience

> "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run." - Amara's Law

> Computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and perhaps only weigh 1 ½ tons. - Popular Mechanics, 1949

What’s the value of knowing the future? How far ahead would you need to be able to look for it to be valuable? In today's fast-paced world, knowing even a moment into the future would be of inestimable worth. Algorithmic traders gain billion-dollar advantages by shaving milliseconds off trades. Knowing the future or even generic characteristics of it can be incalculably valuable. So how would you respond if I told you that there was a roadmap for how all technological advancement would progress along with specific properties at specific growth rates? How would this knowledge affect your decisions on business, investing, and education?

I've been fascinated with predicting the future ever since I got into technology. There’s a sense in which my whole career in information technology has been about predicting the future. As an entrepreneur, I needed to predict the future of the market at the macroscale. This entailed designing technology that was relatively future proof and having some idea of where business was heading. As an Agile practitioner, I need to be able to predict the future at the microscale. This means having a sense of relative size and effort of software engineering tasks and carefully interpreting the past to inform and improve future predictions.

I don’t do any of these things by wizardry or with a crystal ball. It’s done carefully and rigorously by applying principles and trends and observing and extrapolating from the past. And as a scrappy hacker, I look for happy paths and hidden shortcuts to make jumps through the whole process. This philosophy has led me to found and sell two startups, start a software consultancy company, and work, as a currently do, in the health care R&D sector helping teams predict their own performance. This book is my attempt to put my money where my mouth is in the realm of technological prediction and provide a rough outline for an analytical method behind the madness.

A baseball player moves to where the ball is going to be, not to where it is in the moment. Today's entrepreneurs and business leaders need a vision of the future in order to succeed. This can be achieved by relying on one's gut or by leveraging a predictive model built on historically demonstrated quantitative laws. If such a model or explanatory theory does indeed exist, it is of great value. Even if it exists in a grossly undeveloped way, it deserves our attention. This book is the exploration of such a future predicting theory. In it, we will examine how it can be leveraged to give you a personal and corporate competitive advantage. I’ll describe the numerous ways in which it has served me and I’ll also extrapolate some possible outcomes of its manifestation in various domains of knowledge and social trends.

In 1986, the McKinsey consulting group was asked to forecast the number of cell phones that would be in use in the United States by the year 2000; their model predicted fewer than one million, but the actual figure was more than two orders of magnitude greater at 109 million. How could one predict in 1986 what technology would look like by 2000? Or rather, how would that information have benefited someone if they knew ahead of time? No one truly knows the future but a cunning person intelligently utilizes induction to make decisions.

Not your granddaddy’s IT

Many years ago I was privy to an encounter between a group of venture capitalist and a small but established local technology company. I was told of the VC’s tour of the facility and the questions they asked the owner. There were three particular questions/complaints from the potential investors that symbolize the shift in Information Technology that has occurred in only the last couple of years.

“Why is your blog not be updated or maintained?”

Gone are the days when blogging is considered a geeky distraction from ‘real’ work. Your blog is arguably THE most important starting point for promoting your brand. Business to customer (B2C) companies that maintain a blog get 88% more leads per month than companies that don’t blog and yet less than half (roughly 40%) of US companies use blogs for marketing purposes. You can see from these numbers that we’re at a critical juncture.

“Why did you purchase and maintain your own physical servers?”

This highlights the fact that in today’s climate, there must be a clear business reason to maintain your own physical servers. The cost savings and flexibility are just too great to not run your software from the cloud. I see a lot of instances where servers are localized just because the owners are comfortable doing that and because that’s the way it’s always been done. This doesn’t cut it anymore.

“Why aren’t you making your services available via an open API?”

We live in an API-first climate. A business that prioritizes API has engineered itself to be extendable. In addition, one can reasonably question whether development is being done in a test-driven fashion if there is no API. This can be a red flag to any investor trying to get an indication of code quality in a company.

Notable Successes

Let’s look at a few iconic figures who saw the future and acted on it..

[Jeff Bezos](https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/this-prophetic-1997-jeff-bezos-interview-explains-the-genius-behind-amazon?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5)..

From a 1997 Jeff Bezos Interview..

He was inspired by a statistic he learned while working at a hedge fund: In the '90s, web usage was growing at 2,300% a year.

Bezos explains why books, in particular, make for a perfect item to sell on the internet.

Bezos controls nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United States.

> "What's really incredible about this is that this is day one. This is the very beginning. This is the Kitty Hawk stage of electronic commerce." – Jeff Bezos

> “When reporters tracked down Bezos’s high-school girlfriend, she said, “The reason he’s earning so much money is to get to outer space.” This assessment hardly required a leap of imagination. As the valedictorian of Miami Palmetto Senior High School’s class of 1982, Bezos used his graduation speech to unfurl his vision for humanity. He dreamed aloud of the day when millions of his fellow earthlings would relocate to colonies in space. A local newspaper reported that his intention was “to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.” - The Atlantic

Steve Jobs..

From Steve Jobs Playboy interview [as told by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-accurate-predictions-about-future-of-tech.html)..

“The primary reasons to buy a computer for your home now are that you want to do some business work at home or you want to run educational software for yourself or your children,” Jobs explained. However, he imagined the potential.

“This will change: Computers will be essential in most homes,” Jobs predicted.

In 1984, 8 percent of households in the U.S. owned a computer, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By 2000, 51 percent owned computers, and by 2015, that number had climbed to 79 percent.

In 2017, the average American household reported owning two Apple products, according to a poll by CNBC. Today, consumers spend so much of their free time interacting with technology and social media that some experts argue we’re facing tech addiction.

Jobs predicted that what would make computers more useful — for purposes outside of business — would be connectivity.

“The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it into a nationwide communications network,” Jobs told Playboy.

When he made that prediction in ’85, he was four years ahead of Tim Berners-Lee’s 1989 work to develop a system called the World Wide Web. “Berners-Lee wrote the first web page editor and web browser in his office at CERN \[the European Organization for Nuclear Research\], and by the end of 1990, the first web page was posted online,” The New York Times explains.

Optional things to possibly mention:

People in the technology field, like myself, fancy that we are connected and capable and fully adjusted and prepared for the inevitable changes that will happen with the introduction of new technologies. We can easily be tempted to see ourselves in a class entirely different from the older individuals who struggle to fully adjust to the current technological tools and norms we currently enjoy. I suspect that the level of change and the speed with which it is going to hit us is going to be so enormous, that we will all find ourselves equally befuddled and disoriented by the seemingly alien world we’ll be inhabiting 20-30 years from now.

It’s almost become commonplace in my short career to advocate for a particular technology or trend, to subsequently be ignored for a couple years and then finally for what I was promoted to be adopted and those people to finally give me the nod and thumbs up. There is almost never any bitterness in this experience for me. We can’t all be living in the cyberpunk future that my imagination permanently occupies. Especially in the case of enterprise applications were established and proven tech slacks need to be vetted and easily staffed.

Someone has said that most startups aren't wrong, they are just early or late.

JavaScript. Doesn't matter if it sucks. It runs on everything and is accessible. Node.js came.

NoSQL and MongoDB. Low barrier to entry.

Procedurally generated content and basic web design. Started with just the design but later got into regularly procedurally generated content.

In the process of building that company, I found myself in a staffing and team management function. Here to prediction was important. How would different people grow as a technologist and how would the team perform as a unit.

This lead me into the scrum master role where I find myself today.

AI will take the uninitiated knowledge workers

Distribution technologies like IPFS & Blockchain to democratize business monoliths (at least make them more flat)

Quality and the spread of the algorithmic method: Formal methods for design, testing, business models (growth hacking)

Pure mathematical models of systems gain ground FRP & Graph Theory descriptions
