In the previous chapter, we discussed the incredible value of being able to know the future, even if only in general terms. In this chapter, we will get into the meat of the predictive model that will allow us to see that future. This predictive model is called the technological singularity. In much the same way as the laws of physics breakdown in a black hole resulting in a singularity, a point beyond which all predictive power vanishes, so the theory predicts that we are converging on a time in history where it will be impossible to predict the advance of human civilizations because unprecedented changes in technology change the world in ways we have ever known.

Some have pointed out that it a technological singularity must not be too unknowable else we wouldn't be able to talk about it but this unknowability is just a manner of speaking. Because in the same way that physicist talk about a singularity in a black hole they still rigorously theorize about the inner working and mechanics of said blackholes. In much the same way, we don't need to concede to unknowability in discussing the timing or properties of a technological singularity. So how should we understand this singularity if we do not bar against its knowability in some sense? I think we can frame it in the following way. 

A singularity is a tipping point beyond which all previous methods of predicting and understanding are radically and fundamentally changed. I will not spend much time trying to convince the reader that there is an impending technological singularity but I will talk about how such a theory can be useful in making predictions and discuss what I believe are its driving forces and particular spread pattern. 

**Predictive Power**

First, let's take about the predictive power of the singularity..

> “We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist using technologies that haven’t been invented … in order to solve problems we don’t even know are problems yet.” - [Karl Fisch](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-11-06-has-shift-happened-revisiting-a-viral-video-from-2008)

If you don’t grasp the idea of the technological singularity or are not informed as to its driving laws, then you are not prepared to make good strategic business decisions.

Bezos could have seen the 1000% internet growth and interpreted it as a bubble or he could have seen Amazon internal infrastructure growth as just a solution for themselves. Its only through the assumption of unlimited growth potential 

**The Spread Pattern**

aka digital dominance

information technology is growing exponentially in capability versus cost and availability and that anything touched by information technology should expect to see the same growth. 

**Accelerated Change**

**Inevitability**

> “..if the technological Singularity can happen, it will.” - Vernor Vinge

...

**Conclusion**

In the next chapter, we'll discover the driving laws or observable engines of the singularity.

our ability to predict and imagine the future is drastically diminished with time because of these rapid changes, hence the language of singularity. 

Lastly, it states that there will indeed be a kind of last invention of man, namely the creation of the first human-level artificial intelligence. This will be the last invention because all future improvements to that first AI will be accomplished by the previous AI’s resulting in a recursively self-improving ever-growing explosion in artificial superintelligence.

Not every aspect of what’s described above is a necessary element to the theory and not every element is needed for it to be leveraged in an advantageous way.

There are a lot of approaches and methodologies that organically flow from a singularity mindset. But it’s possible to adopt many of these philosophies without understanding the big picture of why they exist. This often manifests in wooden dedication to methods without understanding the spirit and purpose behind their inception. This happens all the time.

Companies adopt agile in a way that makes them less agile or they incorporate a particular device because it’s the new thing without taking into account that there will be a new thing in another week.

Digital Dominance

1.  Digital Dominance
    1.  Demonstrated
        1.  Digital dominance as summarized by Andreessen Horowitz’s that “software is eating the world” demonstrated from economic data and exemplified across domains. Our workspaces, cities, and devices are being swallowed by software at an accelerating rate.
    2.  Explained
        1.  Formulating an explanatory framework for digital dominance. If mathematics is “the queen of the sciences” and together with symbolic logic represents “a calculus of thought”, then digital dominance is the manifestation of the power of externally executable rationality. A development as important as the written word.
2.  The Endgame
    1.  Global Dominion
        1.  All domains of human knowledge will be consumed by digital science. The way domains are being consumed by digital science can be illustrated by a “spread model” - considered in relation to proximate and remote disciplines. Will briefly examine changes to marketing, QA, and DevOps as well as mechanical engineering, pharmacology, and structural engineering.
    2.  Increased Rigor
        1.  Formal verification, organizations and governance as code, financial securities as native data structures and the unification of digital science and pure mathematics.

1.  Our Assumption: Software is Eating the World

*   Examples.. Is it really happening? Can you demonstrate that it is happening? (Rick)
*   A theory of why it might be happening. (Justice)
    *   Mathematics is the queen of the sciences - Gauss
    *   Logic is included in this group is so much as both comprise symbolic calculus or analysis.
    *   Digital Science is executable symbolic calculus.

1.  What Can We Infer From This: (General domain present) The Edge Spread Model

All domains of knowledge will become engineering domains. It’s like the grey goo scenario. It’s going to consume everything. Software is eating the world. That means it’s going to eat your business. This means all problems will become engineering problems. This means your business functions will become engineering functions.

Industries “on the edge” being consumed and transformed by digital science (Insight of trends. Has happening. Is happening):

Marketing => analytics, multivariate testing, growth hacking, and data-driven decision making

QA => automation and continuous integration.

Operations => Infrastructure as code in DevOps.

Finance => Alg and Quant

Computational biology

*   Medical informatics

(General domain future) What does this mean for you? Find where the worm is eating and getting under the bucket. Master the technical tools, formal methods, and executable quantification of your domain or perish. Position yourself for success by moving to where your domain is being consumed. (Prediction. Will become even more engineering-oriented)

QA => formal verification (quote and functional trend and [https://medium.com/imandra/introducing-verified-react-9c2ef03f821b](https://medium.com/imandra/introducing-verified-react-9c2ef03f821b))

Organizations => Distributed autonomous organizations.

Even without the theory of the technological singularity, everything in this book holds true. So please don’t that hold you back from joining with me to imagine what might be because, however you cut it, things are speeding up, technology is proliferating, and culture and industry is going to be dramatically irrevocably affected by it.

The technological singularity is already happening. We’re in it. You just can’t see it.

My dad went on a road trip, as a kid, with his parents to explore a crater. They drove all around town looking for this thing before finally stopping to ask someone where they could find it only to find out that they were in it. The whole town was built in the crater.

Louis CK has a bit called Everything is Magical and No One is Happy where he talks about the marvels of gaming on a cell phone. The fact that messages are being beamed from space to entertain us and yet we’re frustrated and disgruntled because the new Angry Birds level took two seconds to load.

The future is now. You also have not missed it. It would be easy to think that you could have really made it big if you could go back to the early days of the dot com boom but it's a fallacy.

It’s easy to lose perspective of the cultural shift as well.

Ten years ago two solid rules of safety were not to get into cars with strangers and not to meet people in person you've met on the internet. Fast forward to today and we are literally summoning strangers from the internet to get in their car and stay at their house via Uber and AirBNB.

We just keep upping our standards. There is actually a term for this when it comes to artificial intelligence. It’s called the AI affect.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect

List all the things that people said a computer would never be able to do and the dates when computers did those things. How great was the gap?

Accelerated Change

One characteristic of the theory of the technological singularity is accelerated change or time compression as some have called it. It’s simple. The idea is that the approaching changes in technology and society are accelerating and will continue to do so until we reach the point beyond which its impossible to imagine or predict. In fact, the changes are predicted to come so fast that people suffer from something called future shock. These observations were made before modern computers too.

In 1958, [Stanislaw Ulam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam) wrote in reference to a conversation with [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann):

One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#cite_note-mathematical-5)

Endless anecdotal examples could be listed demonstrating how changes in technology and society appear to be accelerating but we can look at concrete examples in a few forms.

Let’s take the metric for how long a particular technology took to reach 50 million users.

It took automobiles, telephones, and electricity around 50 to 60 years to reach 50 million users. With this foundation of mobility established, there arose the need to have more access to financial and communication resources so credit cards, ATM’s, and television came about and took 20 to 30 years to reach 50 million users. It took less than a dozen years for personal computers and cellphones to reach the same number of users. Now we’ll see a dramatic shift in the numbers as digital science rears its head. Computation is the next logical step. Watch as the hockey stick takes off. It only took 7 years for the Internet to reach 50 million user. Facebook did the same in 3 years. Then WeChat did it in 1. Then Pokemon Go did it in 19 days. Are we not in a state of future shock at these numbers.

Let’s consider the metric of time to 1 billion dollar valuation. Old companies like Harley-Davidson, Prada, and Whirlpool took almost a century to reach the 1 billion dollar valuation. More modern companies like Mattel, Nike, and Starbucks did it in a quarter of the time. Now we shall see the emergence of “Internet companies” like Evernote and PayPal do that in less than ten years. As the net gets more established and the network effect takes hold, full-fledged digital companies like Pinterest, Instagram, and YouTube reach 1 billion dollar valuations in less than 2 years. Bird, a scooter on demand San Francisco company has now reached this goal in less than one year.

Founded and IPO’d before lunch..

The same patterns can be seen in time to IPO and social and cultural changes as well. Individuals interviewed for local news one day are singing in music awards shows shortly, they’re remixed interviews having gone viral. Persons peculiar mugshots are signing modeling contracts and appearing in music videos soon after from the same phenomena.

It’s almost impossible for the average Joe on the street to imagine the monumental shifts in culture that are going to take place on the next 30 years.

Inevitability

You can’t regulate the singularity (I & II)

Don't fear the machine uprising. It's inevitable. Presuppose it. Build your business with it in mind.

Many powerful groups in this country are surprised that technology continues to shrink in size and cost while expanding in capabilities and power. These groups are either deluded into thinking that the next 100 years will be similar to the previous 100 years or they have a special interest in maintaining the status quo so they oppose the coming changes.

1.  Eric Schmidt thinks we can globally police autonomous aerial vehicles.

“You’re having a dispute with your neighbor,“ he hypothesized. "How would you feel if your neighbor went over and bought a commercial observation drone that they can launch from their back yard? It just flies over your house all day. How would you feel about it?” - Eric Schmidt

Get a grip. That time is already here. The same could be said of all the advances in a/v recording technology as well.

The State Department thinks they can suddenly control file sharing and 3D printing with it’s recent demands to have the Liberator 3D printed gun files removed from the creator's servers. Not a chance. The original Liberator 3D model was downloaded 100,000 times within days of its posting and is still just as available today on PirateBay. Surprisingly, Kim Dotcom seems just as flabbergasted about the arrival of the Liberator gun. Technologists should know better.

1.  North Carolina is specifically targeting Tesla Motors with a bill that would require car manufacturers to exclusively sell through dealerships. This would be like a state freaking out over the emergence of e-commerce so they pass a bill requiring a ‘store’ to have a brick & mortar location.

Many more examples could be given, _ahem_ Uber. The point is this. If you have an interest in maintaining the status quo, get ready for future shock. IBM’s Watson will be a children's toy within fifteen years. Any business plan or legislative action that doesn't take this into account is destined to be ineffective and outmoded.

In 1987 the world had its first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal. Traders could now type orders directly into a computer.

A trader named Thomas Peterffy didn’t want to type in the orders so he and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal such that it could be wired directly to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms.

A senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy’s setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy’s group one week to fix the problem.

Peterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a mechanical robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard. It’s reported that the inspector stormed out of the room upon seeing the hulking machine but it technically satisfied the NASDAQ rules. Traders said that on active trading days, the robot typed so fast that it sounded like a machine gun.

Peterffy became the father of digital trading. He would write code in his head during the trading day and then apply his ideas to computerized trading models after hours.

Here are 4 essential characteristics of the singularity **mindset**:

1.  Accelerated and unpredictable change

There are people who actually believe that the future is going to be pretty much like the past, that we’re all going to be using smartphones and driving cars just like we do now, 20 years from now. If you fall into this camp, you should NOT be making strategic business decisions for anyone. The new will not be like the old. We don’t know what the future holds, hence the need for a short feedback loop and rapid iteration. This is why agile and post-agile development strategies exist.

1.  Unlimited form factors

It always makes me shake my head when I talk to another technologist and mention either heads up displays or smartwatches and they say something like, ‘I’m not so sure that will catch on.’ You’re not seeing the big picture here bud. If we can put a computer in something, we will. The end game is having all matter in the universe become “smart.” All dust will be smart dust, and all resources will be utilized to their optimum computing potential. See: A computer in every particle

This is why responsive web design exists. It’s not just about making web pages work on phones. It’s about providing a functional pipeline over any channel imaginable. Without this mindset, you will design products that don’t utilize their full expressive potential.

1.  Algorithmic domination

Be very skeptical of any position that relies upon the premise that a task can’t be done or improved upon by a machine. I was speaking excitedly to a finance graduate some years ago in a coffee shop when he scoffingly told me that an algorithm could never invest as well as Warren Buffet. Bad call. If your idea of scaling a business means adding more bodies and paper shuffling, you’re in deep trouble. We are the bottleneck. Bet on the algorithm.

1.  Inevitability

There is no stopping the machine uprising. Don’t ask stupid questions like, “How do we stop it?” You can’t stop it. No one can. See: You can’t regulate the singularity. Legislation has never been able to trump pure technological innovation. You don’t like it? That’s fine. But there’s one certainty in this whole thing, and that’s that you ain’t seen nothing yet. Prepare for future shock.
