In this chapter, we're going to talk about intelligent entities and virtual places. 

**Soft Takeoff**

The end result for all of this is intelligent matter and it won’t stop until everything wakes up. All matter will become smart matter through the Internet of things movement and the drive to convert all dumb matter to computronium. As this happens intelligent agents will appear as agents of change. Intelligence will become a utility. Plug and play smarts. This is a world of talking toasters, ATM’s, snack machines, hotels, houses, and coffee pots.

We’ve been conditioned by science fiction to expect such a change to happen abruptly. One minute you're at the DMV writing a check and the next minute Skynet has taken over the military. This kind of abrupt and dramatic manifestation of human-level AI is called a hard takeoff.

Nick Bostrom, popular Artificial Intelligence academic, thinks this is the most likely scenario and that it will result is a single dominant super AI (a singleton).

“The nature of the intelligence explosion does encourage a winner-take-all dynamic. In this case, if there is no extensive collaboration before the takeoff, a singleton is likely to emerge – a single project would undergo the transition alone, at some point obtaining a decisive strategic advantage.” - [http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html)

In contrast, a soft takeoff posits that everything around us will get smarter and smarter and become a normal part of life and that we will get used to it much like the way we’ve gotten used to carrying supercomputers around in our pockets called cell phones. This view predicts that AI advances will happen incrementally and diffuse throughout society. I believe this is a far more realistic view of how things will unfold, and interesting, almost completely unrepresented in popular AI discussions.

I’m convinced that a general posture of aloofness to the soft takeoff theory in the coming years will likely be a result of people continuously raising the bar of what constitutes intelligence (see the AI effect) rather than looking at the state of technological progress with fresh eyes and perspective. Intelligence will become like water, heat, and electricity to our homes.

**Intelligence as Utility**

> “It \[AI\] will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more than a century ago. Everything that we formerly electrified we will now cognitize.. There is almost nothing we can think of that cannot be made new, different, or interesting by infusing it with some extra IQ… Like all utilities, AI will be supremely boring, even as it transforms the Internet, the global economy, and civilization.” - [https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/01/16/soft-artificial-intelligence-is-suddenly-everywhere/](https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/01/16/soft-artificial-intelligence-is-suddenly-everywhere/)

At this very point, anyone with Internet access and wherewithal can develop on and integrate with IBM's’ Watson and Amazon's’ Alexa. Let that sink in and now extrapolate out ten years.

IN THE PROGRAMMABLE WORLD, ALL OUR OBJECTS WILL ACT AS ONE

> “This is the language of the future: tiny, intelligent things all around us, coordinating their activities. Coffee Pots that talk to alarm clocks. Thermostats that talk to motion sensors. Factory machines that talk to the power grid and to boxes of raw material. A decade after Wi-Fi put all our computers on a wireless network—and half a decade after the smartphone revolution put a series of pocket-size devices on that network—we are seeing the dawn of an era when the most mundane items in our lives can talk wirelessly among themselves, performing tasks on command, giving us data we’ve never had before.” - [https://www.wired.com/2013/05/internet-of-things-2/](https://www.wired.com/2013/05/internet-of-things-2/)

**Technological Animism**

We are about to enter an age of technological animism. Brands will become interactive intelligent service agents. Amazon’s chief evangelist for Alexa and Echo Devices, David Isbitski, describes voice as the new markup language or HTML.

“The whole idea is you can have conversation be the interface for technology in your life,” Isbitski said. “That’s what I like to tell people: Don’t think of this as a new device that is a smart speaker revolution—this really is having voice be the new HTML. It’s the interface for everything.” - [https://www.adweek.com/digital/amazons-chief-evangelist-for-alexa-and-echo-devices-thinks-voice-is-the-new-html/](https://www.adweek.com/digital/amazons-chief-evangelist-for-alexa-and-echo-devices-thinks-voice-is-the-new-html/)

**Fear**

"With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon.” - Elon Musk

“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.” - From an interview with the BBC, December 2014

Ray Kurzweil, a notable evangelist and thought leader for the theory of the singularity predicts that human-level AI will be available by 2029.

**Intelligence vs Volition**

A volitional robot uprising?

(See Bolstrom on intelligence and Volition orthogonal and non-volitional dangers of AI)

See the Orthogonality thesis: [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf)

**What is AI?**

Having a high view by having a low view (History of AI)

AI and ML are not totally new.

Machine learning is not something fundamentally different than what man has been doing throughout the history of technological development.

Writing is external memory..

Arithmetic or any algorithmic procedure is externalized intelligence or artificial intelligence per say..

Seen in this way it may appear that I have a low view of AI but it is in fact a high view because it is what we have been doing from the beginning of human thought.

See and extrapolate: [AI curve fitting is not intelligence](https://diginomica.com/ai-curve-fitting-not-intelligence)

There do seem to be some real argument son how ML and language models are in fact more than a set of if statements. Get into those so you don't misrepresent the intelligence revolution. 

**AI Legal Rights**

Even if we separate intelligence and volition and materially avoid the problem of weather AI has rights, there is still a practical path for software to achieve personhood legal status. That path can be traced as follows. Corporations can be recognized to have personhood right under the current legal framework. With the emergence of distributed autonomous organizations, there now is a way for software to fully execute the responsibilities of a corporation.

The real interesting part is speculating on HOW these shifts will come to pass. I have no doubt that a semi-intelligent expert system will begin to flood all facets of public technology. You will be able to talk to the ATM, public transit, your microwave, and your car and they will respond with the appearance of general intelligence.

Once this kind of human-machine interaction reaches a certain pop culture familiarity then the ‘rights’ of artificially intelligent entities will begin to be discussed. There’s a specific legal mechanism that will lay the foundation for acknowledging AI’s as protected persons and it’s already in place. Under current law, corporations can be defined and operate as legally protected persons. Simply combine this fact with the idea that software is increasingly becoming the backbone of all business processes and you have a recipe for AI persons. Everything from project management to supply chain management software makes it possible for a company to run completely under the semi-autonomous rule of an algorithm.

**Cyberspace**

The very name cyberspace conjures images of computerized locality reminiscent of Disney's Tron so it should strike us as odd if our imaginations stop at computer screens with scrolling text. William Gibson got the idea for the novel Neuromancer after seeing a bus stop poster for Apple. He began to imagine what this future would be like when everybody lived inside a virtual universe. He named that universe “cyberspace”.

“The only computers I’d ever seen in those days were things the size of the side of a barn. And then one day, I walked by a bus stop and there was an Apple poster. The poster was a photograph of a businessman’s jacketed, neatly cuffed arm holding a life-size representation of a real-life computer that was not much bigger than a laptop is today. Everyone is going to have one of these, I thought, and everyone is going to want to live inside them. And somehow I knew that the notional space behind all of the computer screens would be one single universe.” - William Gibson

We are thinking about the future wrong if we are envisioning rooms full of computer screens.

Screens are just the first iteration and computers as large boxes will actually disappear in the future we are entering. Instead of interacting with a screen, the realities behind that screen will become visible in our physical spatial world. Rather than accessing cyberspace, we will come to live within it. The very shift in mentality can historically be seen in the change from using the acronym IRL (In real life) to AFK (Away from keyboard) because our lives online are indeed real lives however augmented and mediated they may be.

The evolution of the human/machine interface has traveled and continues to travel through several definable epochs. Each epoch does not make the previous obsolete but does drastically alter and improve the efficiency and ease of our interaction with technology and information.

The evolution can be described and visualized as follows:

Textual (cli) --> Graphical (gui) --> Haptic (touch) --> Immersive (AR)

Augmented reality is the ultimate foreseeable culmination of the user interface. It is the most direct way to interact with information because it places the UI around you. It’s as if you stepped inside a computer simulation. There are certain necessary technological steps that we must pass through before getting display glasses that throw us into 24/7 simulation space.

One very large challenges is transparent display technology. Fortunately, Samsung has just announced that they will be bringing laptops with transparent displays to market within the next year. As the efficiency of producing transparent displays increases, we will see the technology in smaller form factors. Transparent displays will find their way into our cell phones and tablets. Notice that AR is one of the only real advantages to designing devices with transparent displays.

In time, the technology will reach a point where it is feasible to wear. This will usher in the fully immersive augmented reality world. Entirely new challenges of the user interface will present themselves that make the UI challenges associated with the move from the mouse to touch-oriented seem small in comparison.

Augmented reality will culminate in a fully immersive experience like the one shown in the video below.

A note on the progression of AR:

We’ll likely see the progression happen from transparent displays and direct retinal projections to direct optical nerve signal manipulation.

The AR “layers” UI shift (whole new design patterns)

We are making a world operated by software agents and interfaced through augmented reality. We will indeed be occupying cyberspace, not merely accessing it.
