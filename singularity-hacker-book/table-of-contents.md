No one can predict what's going to happen. That's the part that makes me uneasy about the direction of this book. I'm going to pivot away from prediction. This is the new angle. 

Preppers are oriented towards surviving and thriving in a doomsday scenario. But what about the scenario of a technical apocalypse? I'm talking about an aI explosion, information overload, and radical media manipulation. In the following chapters, I'm going to talk about what I believe the future holds and discuss what one should do to survive and thrive through it. 

I need to rework the direction of chapter one and slightly rework chapters two and three. 

Maybe just change the subtitle to "Visions of The Future" or something.
