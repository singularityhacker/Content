**Hardware**

Like body and spirit, all conceivable instances of computers consist of hardware and software. In the following chapter, we shall examine both the physical substrate and the abstract information side of future machines.

I shall not spend much time speculating on what hardware engineering might be. It is the same to assume that advances and innovations in architecture will continue in such a way that digital power laws are sustained.

Rather than trying to guess the specific physical form that the next generation of computing is going to take, it may be easier to ask what its final form will be and then move backward from that to see what must happen in order to reach that destination.

So what is the absolute end result or manifestation of computing devices? That can be summed up in one sentence. It’s a computer in every particle of matter.

This may sound extreme but this is the end result of what is happening in information technology. This is the physical end game of the singularity. To turn all matter into computable matter.

It’s easy to miss the oddness of the day we live in now surrounded by handheld computers vastly more powerful than the first supercomputers. Consider the following short story from computer pioneer Danny Hillis.

“I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton about 20 years ago. When somebody there predicted the market for microprocessors would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, ‘Where are they going to go? It's not like you need a computer in every doorknob!’ Years later, I went back to the same hotel. I noticed the room keys had been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots in the doors. There was a computer in every doorknob.” - Danny Hillis, circa 1999 ([Source](https://www.amazon.com/Computers-computer-systems-Open-University-ebook/dp/B01D8X6V5I) the location of the reference [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=rMurDAAAQBAJ&pg=PP13&lpg=PP13&dq=a+computer+in+every+door+knob&source=bl&ots=sH4n2oYkD8&sig=ACfU3U2-4ZoQTHDEnMA_Eo1rP1M6aTYYJw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWh6bboNfmAhUl1VkKHZF3BgMQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=a%20computer%20in%20every%20door%20knob&f=false))

There is in fact a name for the matter that is defined by its computing substrate. It’s called computronium.

“..refers to a theoretical arrangement of matter that is the best possible form of computing device for that amount of matter.” - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium)

More on computronium here:

While this may sound purely theoretical, if we work our way back from this end, we can see how many current trends are not just useful but foundational and essential to arriving at this final destination.

Consider the move to IPv6. Information moves across the internet using unique numbers called ip addresses. In earlier versions of this protocol, there were only so many addresses available. Since so many devices have been created and require connection to the internet our need for more unique addresses has exploded. So much so that the current version of this routing protocol had to be hurriedly introduced to account for the exploding number of connected devices. Right now with IPV6, there are enough IP addresses to assign a 1000 to every grain of sand on the earth.

This explosion of connected devices goes by the name of IoT or (Internet of things). Do you see now how all of these disparate trends and technologies make sense after moving backwards from the final foal of a computer in every particle of matter and how this model can inform and make sense of the trends that are currently underway?

Even the point of IoT can be lost when it is seen as merely fitness trackers and smart light switches. In the final analysis, IoT is about pingable matter.

If you don’t know, “pinging” a computer comes from a Unix/Linux network utility. If you wanted to know if a particular machine was online and reachable you would ping it from the command line and if it was online you would get some basic information back. So pingable matter is online and connected objects. Computationally queryable objects.

Smart objects are first then the way they connect is IoT. Get the order and distinction right.

See:

*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_object)
*   [https://medium.com/@darotvillena/the-internet-of-things-iot-is-the-network-of-physical-objects-devices-vehicles-buildings-and-63b621d47aa](https://medium.com/@darotvillena/the-internet-of-things-iot-is-the-network-of-physical-objects-devices-vehicles-buildings-and-63b621d47aa)

We are rapidly approaching a world where buildings know how many occupants they have and report structural integrity issues or fires. I’m talking about buildings, bridges, and appliances that know when they need maintenance. Clothes that measure perspiration and tell you when they need to be washed. Food packaging that optimizes recipes based on taste and expiration dates.

Take something as simple and traditionally “dumb” as a hammer. The hammer of the future knows that it’s a hammer. It knows when and where it was made, when it was sold, who it belongs to, and how many nails its pounded. It carries its own history, expiration date, and material safety data sheets.

Other things we could come to expect from such a trend.

Some practical predictions we can infer from all of the above with regard to all matter becoming computational. Smart objects, form factor, and physical metaphor.

Another confusion that is indirectly addressed by understanding the end result of the singularity is the idea that a particular form factor makes another form factor obsolete. This happens all the time. Personal computers were born and people said it was the end of the mainframe. Laptops come out and people say that desktops are dead. Tablets come out and people say it marks the end of laptops.

Various form factors and interfaces have their own tradeoffs and strengths and this is reflected by all the manifestations that computing is seeing. What I find most interesting is the way icon gestures and items take on new significance by machine intelligence. The glancing at one's wristwatch, for instance, is a natural movement and one deeply ingrained into our history therefore it provides a natural transition for smartwatches and glancing at notifications on the wrist. Many people exclaimed that they already had smartphones to see the time so why would they need a watch again. Those who spoke thus were missing the point. There are advantages that the watch form factor provides that a handset does now such more natural and discreet alerts and a hands-free interface.

I predict that a similar thing will happen with rings. Just as rings of old were used as signets to authenticate messages, so smart rings will be used as digital multi-factor authentication. There are several smart rings yet on the market but the mass market leader in that product category has yet to be born. ~But make no mistake, it will be. ~~

Even the nearly timeless handshake could take on an entirely new significance in a smart ring context if uniquely related cryptographic keys could be exchanged enabling private p2p communication, file transfer, contact information, or digital signatures.

We’re a long way from this vision of things but it’s approaching faster than people realize. Yesterday’s smartphone is today’s smartwatch is tomorrow’s smart ring.

Design parallels with skeuomorphism, the swing away and back to it. Repurposing existing mannerisms with intelligence.

Interface and Device as Metaphor

The best technology leverages metaphor.

In the realm of software and interfaces we have stories (snapchat) and walls (Facebook).

In the realm of hardware we have items and gestures built into us by hundreds or thousands of years of behavior like glasses (AR) and signet rings (2FA smart rings).

This was the philosophical drive behind Google’s UI framework material design.

This was in fact the same angle Steve Jobs took when he understood how valuable the computer mouse was even though Xerox Parc had no idea what they had.

“If I want to tell you there is a spot on your shirt, I’m not going to do it linguistically: “There’s a spot on your shirt 14 centimeters down from the collar and three centimeters to the left of your button.” If you have a spot—“There!” \[he points\]—I’ll point to it. Pointing is a metaphor we all know.” - Steve Jobs

“1983: Apple releases the Lisa, the first commercial computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) — the advance that would finally make computers usable by people with no special training.” - Wired

**Software**

Two primary categories I want to discuss here. Generative design and formal verification. This is what we ask computers to do and how they will be designed to do it.

1.  Generative design: in all areas of engineering. Culminating in the design of software systems themselves. The no code movement.
2.  Formal verification. When maths and software converge. What we are doing now will appear to be stone age by comparison. Bug free code. Not through exhaustive testing but through formal validation like mathematical proofs.

It’s not as though hardware is going to accelerate and we’ll be writing and running the same kind of software we run today. The very nature of our code is evolving as well as our standards of quality. Like the Ouroboros. The snake eating its own tail. Software will eat itself. Code begeting code in growing levels of abstraction.

Self-modifying code. Not necessarily new. We had compilers but this is somewhat different because we will now have layers of the stack that have not been engineered by humans.

This pattern can already be seen from the early days of compilers. User-friendly programming languages were designed to make it easier for programmers to program and the compilation step converted that language into maximally efficient machine language. This kind of pattern will continue. It has never been easier to program and distribute an application.

Software that writes software (tons of new material here)

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has offered a two million dollar bounty for self-healing software. Contestants must submit technical papers about their respective approaches in March of 2015 and be prepared for the ultimate showdown in 2016. The idea is to take zero-days down to zero-seconds. To put the timing of this challenge in perspective, remember that DARPA’s first grand challenge was for autonomous vehicles in 2004. Skip forward almost ten years and every self-respecting automotive manufacturer has plans for a line of automated cars. Following the same timeline, we should see impressive displays of living code around 2020.

Touch on the no-code and low-code movement aka 4th generation programming languages. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language

Machine designed languages..

“There was a time when every computer was in a sense naked—with just its basic CPU. But then came things like operating systems. And then various built-in languages and application programs. What we have now is a dramatic additional step in this progression. Because with the Wolfram Language, we can in effect build into our computers a vast swath of existing knowledge about computation and about the world.”

Software development is about to get more complex, dynamic, and more ‘meta’ then ever previously imagined. We are rapidly approaching a time when our software tools are as complex as the projects we use them on. Code writing code. Software maintaining software. This is just the beginning.

It’s not just for easier human machine interfacing, it’s a path to generative design.

What is generative design?

“Generative design is an iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints, and a designer that will fine tune the feasible region by changing minimal and maximal values of an interval in which a variable of the program meets the set of …” Generative design - Wikipedia

Generative engineering produces stronger, lighter, more efficient components than a mere human can. It’s pretty amazing. You simply tell the computer what you are trying to achieve and it designs the elements according to those constraints and the components tend to look more like biological entities. Like things that were grown, not designed in the traditional sense. This evolution in computational expressiveness not only applies to mechanical engineering but to digital media like games and novels as well.

Procedurally generated video games like No Man's Sky allow users to visit entire worlds where everything is created by algorithm. From the rocks to the animals to the plant life to the weather. None of them were designed by a human ahead of time but were generated by software as needed.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_using_procedural_generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_using_procedural_generation)

Take another example. How about propositional composition like news articles or novels.

“I think 10 years from now computers will be better than humans at reading, listening, talking, and other things. So we are developing this.” - Mark Zuckerberg

“90% of news stories will be written by computers by 2030” - Dr. Kristian Hammond

The language model discovered in 2019 was so good that the researchers refused to release it to the public for fear that it could be used to strategically create mass fake news to influence public opinion.

[https://thegradient.pub/openai-please-open-source-your-language-model/](https://thegradient.pub/openai-please-open-source-your-language-model/)

Every November is National Novel Writing Month (NaNoGenMo) and invites competitors to submit their best procedurally generated novels.

[https://medium.com/@liza/why-i-love-national-novel-generation-month-b8f6e58c6422](https://medium.com/@liza/why-i-love-national-novel-generation-month-b8f6e58c6422)

It’s not just digital good being created either, a new era of DevOps is creating IT systems that look more like biological entities with immune systems and the ability to heal rather than traditional IT systems.

This is not science fiction. The seed of it exist in well established practices such as test driven development and the practice of continuous delivery. But this merely a transition change and is laying the foundation for something incomparably better. That “incomparably better” is formally verifiable systems.

Code Quality: \*TDD vs formal verification

“In the future, as proofs and programs become closer, people will see unit testing as a very primitive way to check program correctness, necessitated only by the limitations of formally incoherent programming languages. Really, we might still be in the Stone Age of programming practices.” - Unifying Programming and Math | The Dependent Type Revolution (Source: [spin.atomicobject.com](http://spin.atomicobject.com/))

Application:

Imagine the value of being able to sell procedurally generated material like narratives.

Soap operas have been on for decades..
