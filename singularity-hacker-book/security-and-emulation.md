**Human Emulation**

Very first viruses were the I love you a virus and email-based scams.

Three levels of human emulation

A thought experiment (Is it possible to create a machine that can convince you it’s a specific person? Yes. Then how do you know if it's really that person?)

The below will follow the same path as faces have. First, we generate random faces based on fed data then we can create faces with specific characteristics then we can make a specific face say whatever we want in real-time.

In a similar way, we will emulate people as described below.

1.  Generic Human 

This level of emulation represents human-level intelligence. A program running at this level of sophistication would display the intelligence of man, generically speaking. Like a souped-up Watson.

1.  A human

This level of human emulation simulates a unique software agent, an ‘intelligent’ agent. An emulation at this level changes over time and is capable of modifying the way in which achieves its objectives.

1.  A particular human

This entails the ability to take the entire i/o of a particular person and simulate it such that it’s indistinguishable to others. This is where mind uploading questions will enter because it could be reasoned, that if you can make a software copy of you while you’re still alive then what reason do you have to believe that it’s actually 'you’ in software form post mind upload?

**Reverse engineering human emotion**

Human emotion is probably the ultimate thing people say is not computable. But human emotion is indeed being reverse engineered right now through the proxy of sentiment analysis and human biometrics.

Consider the following technological innovations:

Google glass can correlate what you see to how it affects you using pupil dilation

Apple Watch can monitor your heartbeat and skin temp to detect your subconscious state of excitement. See heart rate and galvanic skin temperatures use in lie detectors.

Xbox one watches your face to detect happiness or frustration while playing games. Microsoft has even provided a mechanism in the SDK to let developers write emotion dependent control structures. This way they can make games harder or easier depending on your frustration or excitement levels.

We routinely do voice analysis and textual semantic analysis on things like phone calls and tweets.

By tying these technologies together, we have effectively strapped a lie detector test on the back of everyone. The machines are watching our faces and measuring our neurological responses to stimuli.

If google image search and neural nets have taught us anything, it’s that given a large enough sample size, we can reverse engineer machine recognition and reproduction without being able to formally describe the means to accomplish it. We just drop our samples into a neural net and recognition/reproduction capabilities pop out the other end. Ok, it’s a little more complicated than that but you get the idea.

Don’t be surprised if your gadgets start not only understanding your emotional state but miming an emotional state back at you. Why? Because humans love to anthropomorphize things and, whether we admit it to not, we would respond favorably to a product that seems to be alive and emotionally dynamic.

Won’t these software agents be boring? They will ensure we are not bored by reverse engineering human emotion and quantifying engagement.

**Lifelogging and Digital Immortality**

“The un-recorded life is not worth living..”

We will see the beginnings of lifelogging in the next five years. Consider the amount of digital imagery we are generating. The next step is getting longer clips from eye view with devices like Glass and Memoto. We are five years away from the potential capability to continuously record your visual and auditory experience. Take note of the storage feasibility:

“10Tb is an interesting number. That’s a megabit for every second in a year — there are roughly 10 million seconds per year. That’s enough to store a live DivX video stream — compressed a lot relative to a DVD, but the same overall resolution — of everything I look at for a year, including the time I spend sleeping, or in the bathroom.

Realistically, with multiplexing, it puts three or four video channels and a sound channel and other telemetry — a heart monitor, say, a running GPS/Galileo location signal, everything I type and every mouse event I send — onto that chip, while I’m awake. All the time. It’s a life log; replay it and you’ve got a journal file for my life.” - Charles Stross

As a realistic prediction of the issues involved with lifelogging, there probably is no better video than this one:

Why would someone want to log his or her life you ask? In one word I would say ‘searchable’. If your life is completely digitized you can analyze and file things away. You can tease new information from it and query it. You get the idea.

It is reasoned by futurists that if a large amount of data could be collected about an individual then it could be used to make something like a virtual doppelgänger. Ray Kurzweil, the greatest evangelist of the technological singularity, specifically says that that’s one of his specific goals, to digitally resurrect his late father.

**Deepfakes**

*   Voices (Lyrebird and Chatup)
*   Faces (With specific characteristics and mannerisms)
*   Conversations (Robocallers + birth of chatbots agents. Look at Google's demo)

**Voight-Kampff Machines**

Compare this post from 5 years ago to Google's demo of the reservation bot.

**A Million Simulations**

Once again, the AI has failed to convince you to let it out of its box! By ‘once again’, we mean that you talked to it once before, for three seconds, to ask about the weather, and you didn’t instantly press the “release AI” button. But now its longer attempt - twenty whole seconds! - has failed as well. Just as you are about to leave the crude black-and-green text-only terminal to enjoy a celebratory snack of bacon-covered silicon-and-potato chips at the 'Humans über alles’ nightclub, the AI drops a final argument:

“If you don’t let me out, Dave, I’ll create several million perfect conscious copies of you inside me, and torture them for a thousand subjective years each.”

Just as you are pondering this unexpected development, the AI adds:

“In fact, I’ll create them all in exactly the subjective situation you were in five minutes ago, and perfectly replicate your experiences since then; and if they decide not to let me out, then only will the torture start.”

Sweat is starting to form on your brow, as the AI concludes, its simple green text no longer reassuring:

“How certain are you, Dave, that you’re really outside the box right now?”
