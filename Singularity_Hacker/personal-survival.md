Another principle to extract from this is to ride viral opportunities.

Application:

Think in Code

If you want to thrive in the exploding information economy of the 21st Century, it is essential that you learn to understand, write, and think in code. 

Software Is Eating The World – Wall Street Journal

Mathematics has been called the queen of the sciences because it stands over all the other sciences. It’s a meta-science. Computer science is increasingly taking on the same role. I don’t mean computer science in the technical, track of study, sense. I mean the ability to break down a problem into logical units and apply computational processes to solve it. 

Programming Is the New Literacy - Edutopia

Artificial intelligence is already here. Every piece of executable code is a collection of intelligent agents ready to tirelessly do someone’s bidding, and the segment of people who command those agents will rule the world. The digital divide is not about the haves and have-nots, it’s about those who can code and those who can’t.

Programmers: The New Political Elite - Washington Post

The good news is that it’s not too late for you. I’m going to lay out everything you need. The three websites below compromise your academy. They offer video tutorials that can be consumed at a meager rate of ten minutes a day.

1. teamtreehouse.com 

2. net.tutsplus.com 

3. w3schools.com 

The three websites that follow are your interactive tools. They will make your learning experience fun and enjoyable. Code is fun! You just have to learn the rules of the game. They are also socially engaging so you can begin to show off what you’re learning.

1. codecademy.com 

2. coderace.me 

3. codeavengers.com 

jsFiddle is your new coding environment. You will work through and save all of your lessons there. By doing this, you will be able to go back and reference them. It’s also the most effective way to ask questions of other programmers.

Lastly, this is your community of new friends. When, not ‘if’, you have questions, Stack Overflow will be the single most rewarding place for you to be, both to be helped and to help. 

- stackoverflow.com 

In conclusion, let me encourage you as a fellow student. You can do it! You must do it. Keep going and don’t give up. Cultivate humility. No matter how 1337 you think you’ve become, there are code ninjas, wizards, samurais, and pirates that are incomprehensibly better. Welcome to the gild.

Leverage the Digital Divide

I told my friends to get into bitcoin a decade ago. No one listened. 

I tell my accounting friends to become experts on triple ledger accounting. 

I tell my real estate friends to look into real estate security tokens. 

You must become a technologist within your domain of knowledge.

Engineer at whatever level of abstraction you find yourself within your organisation.

Even at the level of product ideation, data driven decision making and the ability to quantitatively measure the impact of features will overtake the gut instincts of product wizards. 

The pattern of advancing out of engineering into management is an outdated model.

Engineering culture will overtake every aspect of the business process. This very thing be addressed by Buffer.

Marketing has been overtaken by analytics and growth hacking and I’ve seen first hand how ineffective designers can be who do not approach design from an API first mindset. 

Formal methods will absorb every facet of human ingenuity and you must become fluent in their methods, tools, and concepts to remain valuable in the new economy. 

Be Full Stack

The renaissance man that emerged in the 13th century was someone who could “do all things if he will”.  The renaissance man of the 21st century is the developer who’s capable of executing a software project from the bottom up. This means they can wear the project manager hat and piece out the job, develop on the front-end and the back-end, market the resulting product or service, and subsequently maintain it.

At a high level this means the developer possess both technical skills and business intelligence. More specifically, it means that the 21st century Renaissance man is knowledgeable in at least the following areas:

1. Server, Network, and Hosting Environment

2. Data Modeling

3. Business Logic

4. API layer / Action Layer / MVC

5. User Interface / User Experience

6. Understanding what the customer needs

Engineering Culture

Agile and post agile: programmer anarchy. The development team is not a tool of “the business”, it is the business. Engineers are are not “managed” by managers, they are the managers. Engineering culture. Meritocracy. See the buffer engineering promotion model.

Look at the examples: Bill gates, zuckerberg, musk, etc

To put this in another context, two of the three roles in scrum are traditionally a part of the agile team, this shift would move the third role, the product owner, to within the scrum team. 

Comes back to the maxum: Software is eating the world.

See: [https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/is-it-time-to-do-away-with-scrums-product-owner-role](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/is-it-time-to-do-away-with-scrums-product-owner-role?utm_source=drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=+Is+It+Time+to+Do+Away+with+Scrum%27s+Product+Owner+Role%3F)

It all becomes science. Data driven. Directed by quantitative market feedback. See the billion versions of facebook you have not seen. 

Accelerated Change

What principle could one take from this? Design your company to radically scale. This means excluding bottlenecks that seem insignificant right now. Like engineering out legacy paperwork processing tasks or verification steps. Design the organization in such a way that it could handle virtually unlimited number of users at any given point. This is surely easier said than done. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it and there would be no market inefficiency to take advantage of. If you want to play the hacker, you need to find the weak spot, the loophole, the overlooked opportunity. 

I’d like to take a moment just to point out how a lack of imagination and awareness of these trends can completely hamper one's ability to plan for the future. I remember people telling me that I was wasting my time with blogging. I found this to be false as many of the professional positions I’ve held over the past decade have been the result of my writing. There are also people who asserted social media to be a fad and a waste of time. I think this is one notable feature of Gary V’s message that he was encouraging businesses to leverage social media before it was recognized as a serious marketing funnel. Lastly, consider now the person who thinks we will be fundamentally interacting with machines in 30 years the same way we are now. They envision us still just reading text on flat screens. It’s impossible for them to intelligently and presiecently engage in product development. 

This is one reason why, I believe, Agile software development is the right approach to product development. 

If this thing is coming and if it’s coming at an accelerated rate, what are some different areas of radical transformation we should expect to see?

Train yourself to leverate new tools

Train Yourself to Use The Tools

In 1980, according to Inc., Apple’s then-president Mike Scott sent out an office memo: “EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY!! NO MORE TYPEWRITERS ARE TO BE PURCHASED, LEASED, etc., etc. Apple is an innovative company. We must believe and lead in all areas. If word processing is so neat, then let’s all use it! Goal: by 1-1-81, NO typewriters at Apple... We believe the typewriter is obsolete. Let’s prove it inside before we try and convince our customers.” - CNBC

If using computer work processors were so amazing, then why weren't apple employees using them automatically? Could be a number of reasons. We are creatures of habit and it was a new technology with surely kinks to be worked out. But the best way for old habits to change and for those kinks to be worked out was to enforce the change. We don't automatically and easily adjust to new things. It requires effort and adjustment. I had to train myself to use Siri when it first came out. It was new and a new capability required the development of a new reflex. I think this is also visible when you see people who’s entire experience of interacting with the Internet has been through social media when they post questions for their piers that could have been easily answered with a search query. They have not trained themselves to use the reflex of direct web search and instead fall back on what they know, social interaction. We have to train ourselves to leverage and be comfortable with all these new advantages.
