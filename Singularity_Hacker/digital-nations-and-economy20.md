# Economy 2.0 in The Technological Singularity

1.  Defi
2.  M2M Marketplace

Let’s consider the metric of time to 1 billion dollar valuation. Old companies like Harley-Davidson, Prada, and Whirlpool took almost a century to reach the 1 billion dollar valuation. More modern companies like Mattel, Nike, and Starbucks did it in a quarter of the time. Now we shall see the emergence of “Internet companies” like Evernote and PayPal do that in less than ten years. As the net gets more established and the network effect takes hold, full-fledged digital companies like Pinterest, Instagram, and YouTube reach 1 billion dollar valuations in less than 2 years. Bird, a scooter on demand San Francisco company has now reached this goal in less than one year. Founded and IPO’d before lunch..

In 1987 the world had its first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal. Traders could now type orders directly into a computer.

A trader named Thomas Peterffy didn’t want to type in the orders so he and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal such that it could be wired directly to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms.

A senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy’s setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy’s group one week to fix the problem.

Peterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a mechanical robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard. It’s reported that the inspector stormed out of the room upon seeing the hulking machine but it technically satisfied the NASDAQ rules. Traders said that on active trading days, the robot typed so fast that it sounded like a machine gun.

Peterffy became the father of digital trading. He would write code in his head during the trading day and then apply his ideas to computerized trading models after hours.

p2p exchanges. You can’t regulate singularity.

The cypherpunks and Julian Assange, and our slide in totalitarianism.

Consider polymath. The stock market has been consumed by algorithmization. Look at the chart. The majority of all stock trades today are M2M. Security tokens platforms like Polymath make it easy for companies to issue financial securities on the blockchain. They make it possible to do this while complying with compliance and regulation requirements.

Look at it this way. If alg trading was the internet reaching out to trade on our stock market. Security tokens are moving the entire stock market to the internet to be a fully digital native. Soon we’ll see business models and financial instruments created entirely by ML and AI. Mechanisms and schemes that will appear completely incomprehensible to humans at first. This is economy 2.0. This is the new machine economy.

How deep does this rabbit hole go? How many financial instruments are there and how many more could there be and how complex could they get? Is anyone developing these with the help of ML now?

The idea of passively selling procedural generated digital goods is what drove me to co-found my first software company. A business approached me about building websites for their clients. They wanted to pay me per site but by that time, I had become fairly bored with building websites and was more interested in applications so me and my co-founder built an application that generated websites given user-supplied constraints. Later on, the same idea drove us to replace the company's content writers with procedurally generated content. The idea was that we could re-generate the content across hundreds of sites and re-submit them for indexing and get ranked in search engines.

Unrecognizable business models, financial instruments, and economies.

Self-owned machines.

\*Polymath

The beginning of digital trading story. The machine mechanically typing the keyboard and the next step to securities. Digitally native securities.

Less than 10% of stock trading is done by humans. All the rest is machines. Quantitative investing based on computer formulas and trading by machines directly are leaving the traditional stock picker in the dust and now dominating the equity markets, according to a new report from JPMorgan. Notice the rise of M2M trading in the following insane gif.

Look at it this way. Algorithmic trading are the bots reaching out from cyberspace to trade on our stock market. A new project aims to take that to the next level. Enter Polymath. Polymath aims to make it easy for companies to put all financial securities (stocks, bonds, venture capital, and private equity) on the Blockchain.

They call this new approach a security token offering (STO) and contrast it with the utility tokens or ICO’s all the other companies are promoting. They are doing all this in compliance with SEC regulatory requirements and know-your-customer (KYC) laws.

If that doesn’t cause your jaw to drop, look at it this way. If the machines are reaching out to trade on our stock market, Polymath is moving the stock market and the whole world of financial securities to the machine world via the Blockchain. Full stop. Let that sink in. Programmable securities. Financial instruments reimagined as pure data structures.

I was never a car guy until Tesla. Tesla changed at that. It was described as a computer on wheels with its own API. I could understand that and get behind it. It suddenly interested me very much. Polymath is going to do the same thing for finance. If software is eating the world, it’s about to consume the most profitable game in town. Finance. Put your seatbelts on and keep your eye out for Polymath.

API first design is a corollary to assuming an m2m economy.

The basic principle of an information economy is that the individuals who can perform the most efficient, creative, and useful transformations on data make the most money. That's an oversimplification but it still gets at the heart of the matter. Well, what happens when the tools of information processing become dramatically more powerful? Productivity and value explode. Today, a teenager with a $200 tablet computer can process information with greater efficiency than an entire organization of fifty years ago.

This is nothing compared to the productivity increases society is about to see in the next fifty years. We are on the verge of seeing an explosion in personal software agents.

A software agent is a software program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency. - Wikipedia/Software\_agents

Think little personal AI’s that tirelessly do our bidding. Let's look at the first players in this budding market.

# Digital Nations in the Technological Singularity

**Decentralized Governance**

It’s already happening. See: [https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/01/06/day-1-apple-state-of-the-nation-2/content.html?sig=3Da9Giih1ATNXZEbc0Gqtf-UPHEEStMIOjMY5AFMW8Q](https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/01/06/day-1-apple-state-of-the-nation-2/content.html?sig=3Da9Giih1ATNXZEbc0Gqtf-UPHEEStMIOjMY5AFMW8Q)

Estonia e-residency program: [https://e-resident.gov.ee/digitalnomad/](https://e-resident.gov.ee/digitalnomad/)

Software is consuming everything. It will consume government and it will consume the economy even more than it already has. Let’s look at these in order.

One function of government is to enforce an agreement between parties. Smart contracts platforms attempt to solve this with technologically enforced execution. But there is still a problem here because whoever controls the technology actually controls the enforcement. We have just shifted the power. So if a blockchain protocol is written and maintained by a handful of engineers, those engineers can with a single update do whatever they want. They could reverse the transaction or even stop the execution of a contract. The way this is being addressed is with on-chain governance protocols. The idea is simple. You don’t permit updates to the blockchain code it’s else’s unless certain constraints are met such as voting or some such other governance mechanism. In this way, updates to the smart contract platform are themselves technologically enforced by a smart contract.

Once again we are back to the code idea of the DAO.

So far we have spoken of organizational government but this could equity be applied to government ie the civil magistrate. There is an excellent talk about how our government is running on an outdated operating system.

What would a modern operating system look like? The idea of codifying existing law into a formal language is being pursued right now. Just imagine. Governments have labored for millennia trying to create laws that are consistent and yet, only when the law is translated from natural language to form a language do we have the means to rigorously check or demonstrate its consistency.

One novel, but a useful lens to view government is to frame it in terms of membership with terms of service where membership equals citizenship and the TOS are the civil laws. This the American constitution for instance. In this scheme, your membership affords you certain rights and with those rights, you have certain responsibilities.

Forming distributed nations along lines of ideology makes more sense than forming them entirely on geospatial ones. Has this not already happened. Consider the wildly opposing ideologies and philosophies of America’s left and right into political groups. At odds on every issue from emigration, economics, human rights, religion, history, etc and yet the war to enforce each ideology is continually forced upon an ideologically divided geo spacial lines are by pendulum swinging leaders.

What is citizenship was a membership where you had votes and responsibilities specific to your membership. In some ways, we are seeing the seed of these things now in a few ways.

*   The growing power of social networks. Facebook has become too large to control and they will likely be launching their own currency.
*   Wildly increased alignment on ideology and means of communication and organization among proponents of similar world views
*   The rise of digital nations. Estonia has launched the first residency.

Once again let me take this back to first principles. I am not particularly advocating for any of this. I’m simply acknowledging that the digital dominance principle will be seen in this area and that cannibalization of organization and government by technology is inevitable. Remember. All matter will become thinking. "Place" will become abstracted and ephemeral. We are converging on the singularity and this is what that looks like. We will be governed by the machines. Even more, than we already are.

Post nations, Politics, and Governance, and Sovereignty:

Another function of government is physical force. Just because we are being transformed by cyberspace doesn’t mean we cease to exist in meatspace. How does an ideology aligned elation defend itself from physical force? The answer is scarily right in front of our faces. The advancement of technology has made it possible for small groups of people to wage war in ways that only armies could in the past. Consider what has happened. In the past, a ruling power could squash any insurgency with relative ease just through the power of numbers. A zealots group would arise from the Jews to overthrow Roman rule and the government would just send legions of troops into to overpower them. What great harm could ten men cause with swords?

Consider today because of the power of technology. A single man could kill and destroy undress or thousands through automatic weapons, poisons, or homemade explosives. Francis Schaefer predicted this rise in terrorism and Nick Bolstrem predicts that it will increase in dramatic ways.

We are converging on a time when the following assets can be produced and controlled from a computer keyboard:

*   Distributed organizations, communication, and government
*   Terrorism
*   Currency
*   Propaganda

I don’t want to get into the ethics of warfare and terrorism, The entire discussion of what constitutes a just war is profoundly philosophical/theological and beyond the scope of this work. I simply want to point out that it has now become possible for e-nations to wage war.

**Combat Ops**

Running Wars from a Keyboard

There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Every strength has a cost. The same technologies that enable distributed anonymous communication enable terrorist organizations to communicate unimpeded. Or the same advances in additive manufacturing make it possible to print firearms from the comfort of your bedroom.

This creates a genuine dilemma for nation-states trying to enforce the rule of law in a technological singularity. It is possible today to start a full-blown war from a keyboard.. full stop. I want to talk about three mechanisms that are being leveraged to do that very thing.

Communication: Who needs dead drops and burner phones when you have distributed social networks. Enter Diaspora. Diaspora came about because people didn’t want Facebook to own their data. Diaspora operates on a node/pod basis such that each pod is autonomous and shares its user's info with other pods. Anyone can fork the Diaspora code and fire up a pod on any server. Instant scalable social network. Strangely enough, it’s the primary means the terrorist group ISIS is using to communicate now.

Funding: Money laundering is so old-timey. With Bitcoin or any altcoin for that matter, even high profile figures can funnel unlimited funds to special interest groups anonymously. It effectively becomes possible to crowdsource military operations from a keyboard from within the state you are waging war against using its own economy and citizens.

Armaments: Arms dealing is dead. 3D printed firearms have disrupted the scene. Printed firearms are undetectable and untraceable and can be assembled on a just-in-time basis. And it’s not just firearms anymore. Printed drones are becoming a thing. I’m envisioning a future where you can have a war kit in a suitcase. Open it up and guns and a cloud of drones fly out. Yesterday's crockpot bomb is tomorrow's printed nuke.

Last but not least we have advances in Intelligent Systems. The concept of a DAC (Distributed Autonomous Corporations) can and is being applied to combatant endeavors in the form of assassination markets.

Combat DACs can be disastrous to standard counter-terrorism techniques which rely on social network analysis (SNA) to ferret out cells and cell members. Using a DAC would mean there’s no critical communication between cell groups or cell members and that no single operative has enough knowledge to compromise the operation. Each player would be independently directed by the DAC to achieve the overarching mission.

If you haven’t seen Balaji Srinivasan’s talk on Silicon Valley’s Ultimate Exit then watch it now. What he describes is an opting out of nation-state citizenship on a technological and economic level. The idea is that you could have cyber nations on top of “real” ones. The interesting part about the above observations is that it’s not only possible to opt-out in the Srinivasan fashion but also possible for these cyber nations to wage war against the meatspace nations they inhabit and to, thereby, assert their own sovereignty.

*   Estonia and e-residency
*   Silicon Valley's Ultimate Exit (Search) !!!!!
*   3D Printed guns
*   Assassination market places
*   Legal DDOS’s
*   Information warfare (fake news)
*   Will not replace physical nations but be layered on top of them. Like political parties.
